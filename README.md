# BMSAssignment
Firstly, sorry for the delay.

1. In this project, I have used firsty loaded the movie list screen.
2. On click of book button, I have pushed to the movie detail screen.
3. On Book button, I wanted to animate it but due to time constraint I could not. Also we can open SFSafari or WKWebview on click of homepage, which is a simple label right now
4. On back, we again land on movie detail screen.
5. On search bar click, search screen is presented.
6. I have used core data. This was also possible by userdefaults or temporary storing in the file memory. On click of movies that are already selected, I show a popup.
7. Also there is a limitation to add more than 5 selecte movies.

Thankyou.
